
Design a system that sends 1 byte of data in 2 seconds. You should select two pins ((gpio input and output)) one drived from your name and one from your surname (like you were supposed to in the first midterm). Ä°n put string should be entered through usb interface and the output string should also be echoed through usbcdc and all the necassary parameters be should be configurable through usb .

a) (30 pts due to 30th of May) be able to produce your 2 seconds signal and monitor it in STM32Cube monitor . In case you are using a simulation software find another way to demonstrate.
